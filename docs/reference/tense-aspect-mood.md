# Tense, Aspect and Mood

Sentences in Kokanu in the basic form with just a subject and action can occur at any time (tense), can be completed or incomplete (aspect), and can be real or wished/requested (mood). Within the surrounding context of a sentence, these details are often understood implicitly. If the situation requires you to specify, you can use some clarifying words to reach different types of tense, aspect and mood. This article will dive into all three to give you the tools to express many of the different types in Kokanu.

Tense
-----

A verb's tense tells you the position in time that the action occurred from the perspective of the speaker/writer. The main tenses are considered to be **past**, **present** and **future**. Some languages group **present** with either **past** or **future**. Kokanu sentences are considered **tenseless** and often times you can determine the tense through context, but you can clarify by using these modifiers in the verb clause.

### Past

Use the word $matin in a verb clause to indicate that the action occurred "previously":

$kuku $le $kosan **matin** $in $niwa $namu. “The bird built a nest.”

$mi $le $tun **matin**. "I did (it)." (lit. I do previously)

### Present

Use the word $kenca in a verb clause to indicate that the action occurred "currently":

$kuku $le $kosan **kenca** $in $niwa $namu. “The bird is building a nest.”

$mi $le $tun $kenca "I do (it)." (lit. I do currently)

### Future

Use the word $melon in a verb clause to indicate that the action occurs "next":

$kuku $le $kosan **melon** $in $niwa $namu. “The bird is going to build a nest.”

$mi $le $tun $melon "I will do (it)." (lit. I do next(ly))

Aspect
------

**WIP: we need to add in mulu and luka, and i think we should also remove the perfective/imperfective stuff (throughout this section)**

A verb's aspect tells you the flow of time during which the action occurred from the perspective of the speaker/writer. The main categories of aspect are **perfective** and **imperfective**. 
- A **perfective** aspect looks at an action or state as being completed or whole (without detail of the internal flow of the event).
- An **imperfective** aspect looks at an action or state as being in an unfinished or partial state (focusing on internal detail of the flow of the event instead of the event as a whole).

This may seem confusing and in fact some languages group aspect and tense together. Kokanu sentences are fundamentally **aspectless** which means there is no special changes that you make to a verb to indicate the aspect. Instead, Kokanu encourages you to try to rely on context, often times it is all that is needed for your readers/listeners to understand your intended aspect. If that's not enough, Kokanu does offer some clarifying words that can be used adverbially in a way that informs the aspect of the sentence.

### Prospective

The **[prospective]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_aspect))** aspect (also known as antiperfect) expresses actions that have not yet begun but are expected to occur soon. It contrasts with the perfect aspect, which describes actions that have already been completed. In Kokanu, this aspect is marked by the modifier lito.

$kuku $le $kosan **lito** $in $niwa $namu. “The bird has yet to build a nest.”

$mi $le $kota lito "I haven't started speaking / I'm about to start speaking"

### Starting (Inceptive/Ingressive)

This **imperfective** aspect expresses actions that are incomplete and just beginning. Use the word $tepu in a verb clause to indicate that the action is "starting":

$mi $le lo wiki $tepu "I started to run"

### In Progress (Continuous)

This **imperfective** aspect expresses actions or states that are incomplete and still in progress. Use the word $conca in a verb clause to indicate that an action or state is "ongoing":

$mi $le $makan **conca**. "I am eating."

$ja $le $lo $wiki **conca** $matin. "They were running fast."

### Stopping (Cessative)

This **imperfective** aspect refers to the end of an action or a state. Use the modifier $konje to indicate that the state or action is "stopping" or "finishing".

pawo $le $kota $konje in sema "The dog stopped barking"

### Frequentative

This **frequentative** is used to indicate repeated, habitual, or iterative actions. Use the modifier **cunpu** to indicate that the action occurs in a recurring manner.

$mi $le $lo $wiki **cunpu** "I used to run / I run (habitually)"
