# wi

This page is incorrect and should be fixed!
While the word "wi" is used here, it is used in the old sense of "wi", not as a standard modifier-forcing particle. This page should be edited to reflect that meaning.

Kokanu has two forms of negation: using the **no** particle modifier after other grammar particles and using the **wi** particle before content words. This guide helps explain when to use the latter particle and what it means.

First thing to note is that **wi** forces the immediately following word into modifier form. Secondly, it marks the modifier as being a "reverse", "opposite" or "negated"  form. This allows you to interject some negated modifiers within a larger description and helps ensure sentences don't require constantly returning to either the verb or prepositional forms (using **no**) when you need to express a mix of positive and negative traits. Let's cover how that works in practice for each content word derivation type.

Verb
----

When used with a verb, the combined expression means:

*   does not resemble \$generic object of verb\ $makan

*   does not resemble food
*   un-food-like
*   uneaten
*   inedible

Modifier
--------

When used with a modifier, the combined expression means "un\$modifier\ $konpa

*   unshaking/unvibrating

Noun
----

This form's most useful meaning is "un-\$noun\ $kun \$noun\ \$noun\ $meja

*   un-cat-like

### $le $wi X

This should always be interpreted as a modifier acting as a verb

*   **$le $no $makan** "not eat"
*   **$le $si $makan** "is edible"
*   **$le $wi $makan** "is inedible"

### $le $no $wi

It doesn't interact with **no** within itself as it is already a negator, though **le no wi X** is technically fine (though redundant) because **no** acts on **le**.

#### $le $no $wi $makan

*   is not inedible

### $le $wi X $pon

**wi** does not interact with **pon** within itself, but **le wi X pon** is fine because **wi X** just acts like a modifier.

#### $le $wi $makan $pon $je $sito

cause the bread to be inedible

#### $le $no $wi $makan $pon $je $sito

not cause the bread to be inedible

#### $o $no $mu $no $wi $makan $pon

*   don't be a non-en-inedible-er
*   non-en-inedible-er
*   an entity that doesn't cause things to be inedible
