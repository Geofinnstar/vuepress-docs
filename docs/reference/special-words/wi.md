# wi

$wi is a derivational marker that forces words into base modifiers. This means that it can take a phrase, and turn it into a base modifier.

The phrase $wi $no is often used to negate modifiers, as $no has to attach to a grammatical particle.

If $wi is used with a base noun, the meaning becomes "noun-like", instead of "noun-related".
